/*
  Draw a to do list with two columns: item, and importance
    - the to do, is your queue item

  Have students give you a to do and it's importance with 1 being most important
  When the list is empty, where does it go?

  Once first item is added, have students give more to dos,
  explain the process that you decide where to add the new to do,
  based on it's importance, is essentially a loop. You visually loop
  through the list until you find the first item that is not as
  important, then you put the new item in that position.
